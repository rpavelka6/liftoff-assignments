# Project Outline

### Overview
My Inspector Estimate app will allow pre-purchase inspectors from Vinebrook Homes to complete the pre-purchase inspection electronically.  The inspector will add the items that need to be brought up to Vinebrook standards and then a budget estimate for the job will be calculated.  This budget estimate will be sent to the broker of the property purchase.  If the broker does purchase the house the inspector will be able to create a Scope of Work directly from the information already stored in the database eliminating the need to retype the information collected during the inspection.

### Features
User Login - user's will be able to create an account to perform their inspections.  
Property Search - Inspectors will be able to search for properties already inspected and retrieve the data to create a Scope of Work or other purposes.
Create Budget Estimate - Inspectors will be able to create a budget estimate from the data input during the initial inspection.
Create Scope of Work - Inspectors will be able to create a Scope of Work from the initial inspection.
